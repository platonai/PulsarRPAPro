= Exotic README

Exotic is the professional edition of Pulsar with advanced AI support to do link:exotic-app/exotic-ML-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/[Auto Web Mining].

There are already dozens of link:exotic-app/exotic-examples/src/main/kotlin/ai/platon/exotic/examples/sites/[scraping cases] for the most popular websites, we are constantly adding more cases.

Exotic demonstrates:

* How to use Exotic as a standalone server with a minimal web console to manage scraping tasks
* How to use Pulsar as a library
* How to use Pulsar driver to access the Pulsar REST service
* How to extract almost every field in any webpages automatically in an unsupervised manner using our advanced AI
* How to use Exotic as an #intelligent CSS selector generator#, the generated CSS selectors can be used in any traditional scrape systems to extract data from webpages.

The best CSS selectors for each field are generated automatically, you can use these rules for web scraping in the old-fashioned way:

Note that the website in this demo uses CSS obfuscation techniques, so the CSS selectors are hard to read and changes frequently, and there is no other effective technology to solve this problem other than machine learning based solutions.
