The easiest way to use proxy is to copy link:./proxy.providers.txt[proxy.providers.txt] to the directory: `~/.pulsar/proxy/providers-enabled`. The file `proxy.providers.txt` contains the url to fetch proxies from external proxy vendors.

Currently, we support two external proxy vendors: zmhttp.com and dailiyun.com, other vendor supports will be added later.

Another alternative is to put `proxy.providers.txt` in your user home directory, which is `~` under Linux or `%USERPROFILE%` under Windows, and use script `proxymgr` to enable/disable/list the proxies:

    # Enable all proxy providers
    bin/tools/proxy/proxymgr epd -all

    # Disable all proxy providers
    bin/tools/proxy/proxymgr dispd -all

Run the script for help:

    bin/tools/proxy/proxymgr
