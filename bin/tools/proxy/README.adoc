The easiest way to use proxy is to put `proxy.providers.txt` into the directory: `~/.pulsar/proxy/providers-enabled`. The file `proxy.providers.txt` contains the url to fetch proxies from external proxy vendors.

Currently, we support two external proxy vendors: zmhttp.com and dailiyun.com, other vendor supports will be added later.

We suggest you to put `proxy.providers.txt` in your user home directory, that is, `~` under Linux, `%USERPROFILE%` under Windows, and use script `proxymgr` to enable/disable/list the proxies:

    # Enable all proxy providers
    bin/tools/proxy/proxymgr epd -all

    # Disable all proxy providers
    bin/tools/proxy/proxymgr dispd -all

Run the script for helps:

    bin/tools/proxy/proxymgr
